# Front End Folder tldr

This exists mostly for sorting things, and we'll rearrange folders for functionality later on.

The github built in percentages seem to be ignoring how much javascript is embedded in my HTML, which is a bit annoying, but oh well.

Some of this js might have to be rewritten in php, but as I go I'm trying to include a commented out version of what a database backend implementaiton would look like. The active version of most of this code will be filled with placeholder values.
